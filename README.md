# Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository is a small library for simple implementations of the following deep reinforcement learning algorithms written in pytorch.

This was built mainly for learning purposes. It may also help others who are learning deep RL and looking for simple implementations. I am following [OpenAI's Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html) documentation for guidance on algorithm details. I also used the [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) as a reference for code structure implementation.

Here are the following algorithms:
- Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)

<!-- - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Twin Delayed DDPG 
- Soft Actor-Critic -->
