# Pytorch Implementations of Deep RL Algorithms in OpenAI's SpinningUp

## Introduction

This repository has pytorch implementations of the algorithms in [OpenAI's Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html). I also used the [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) as a reference.

Here are the following algorithms implemented so far:
- Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG) [~110 lines of code]

<!-- - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Twin Delayed DDPG 
- Soft Actor-Critic -->
<!-- 
Here are some resources that helped me understand each algorithm:

## Getting Started

Make sure to have to have the following packages installed:
- [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- matplotlib
- numpy
- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- Download the repository by clicking the green button labeled 'Clone or download' on this page. Alternatively, if you have git locally, you can clone at the terminal command line by using the command `git clone https://github.com/cjm715/deeprl-spinningup-pytorch.git`.

## Instructions

To see a demonstration of any algorithm run the command `python demo_[algo].py` from root of this repository. This will train an agent, save output files, and render the environment under control by the trained agent.
